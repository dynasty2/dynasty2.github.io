**List of Technologies Used**
* HTML
* CSS
* Sublime.

**Getting Started**
First, choose a website "mock-up" that you appreciate, as if a designer or client brought you their layout vision.  Next, wireframe out the layout in order to plan how you will actually build your site, therefore increasing efficiency throughout later steps in the creative process.  Then create a repository within your personal github to host the project.  Clone all necessary information locally in order to open your prefered text-editor.  Once you have linked up your CSS file to your HTML, begin effecting your code in order to satify your "boss or client's" project idea.  Remember to push your work back up to your project's remote repository in order to back up and track changes.  Continue to pursue exact similarity via mulitple small changes. Finally, deploy your website project using Github pages.
